# In the transcript FASTA file, a mRNA transcript is given a name such as Leke_00000001-RA
# which corresponds to transcript transcript variant 1 for gene Leke_00000001
# the corresponding protein is in the protein FASTA file and is also called Leke_00000001-RA
# Leke_00000001-RB would be transcript variant 2 for gene Leke_00000001
# Leke_00000001-RC would be transcript variant 3 for gene Leke_00000001
# etc...
# the gene have names such as Leke_00000001, Leke_00000002, Leke_00000003, etc. and their functions are in the GFF file in the 9th column under the section called Note=
# in the Note= section, there is a Gene Abbreviation followed by a description followed by the species the annotation came from followed by the UniProt species id
# an example with Leke_00000001
# It has the following note section "Note=Similar to ALP1: Protein ANTAGONIST OF LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (Arabidopsis thaliana OX%3D3702);"
# ALP1 is the gene abbreviation
# Protein ANTAGONIST OF LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 is the gene description
# Arabidopsis thaliana is the species the closests BLAST match came from
# OX%3D3702 (really OX=3D3702, can't have = signs in GFF file, except for Note=) means UniProt species 3D3702 [as far as I know]
# Note that some of the gene abbreviations such ALP1 might be lowercase in some entries ALP1 vs. Alp1
